#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of largest product in series

Create a generator succesive_seqs that takes a length and string and

The first solution used a loop to calculate the max and I felt python
"pushed" me in that direction.
After browsing through my ruby implementation and seeing a solution using
map I realised there was a more eloquent way.
