#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of summation of primes

use previous hand baked prime generator and collect values up to limit the sum

** Retrospective

Unsatisfactory implementation of solution. Generating primes from kvals and checking
if prime by seeing if any prior primes are prime factors becomes very slow at
higher numbers.

This need to be reimplemented trying a seiving algorithm as the upper limit is
known and so python can lazily create a list up to that limit to form the basis
of the seive.
