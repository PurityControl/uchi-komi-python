#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of largest product in series

create a generator that returns pythagorean triplets totalling a
certain amount then get the first and calculate the product

** Retrospective

Getting to the solution highlighted a number of differences between
python 2 and 3

In python 2 range would create a list of sequences putting the whole
list into memory, to do this lazily you used xrange. In python 3 range
does what xrange did and xrange has been removed.

In python 2 you got then next sequence of an iterator / generator by calling
.next() on the iterator. In Python 3 this is implemented as __next__, but you
should use next(iterator) not iterator.__next__().

ie. Python2 what iter.next(), Python 3 is next(iter)
