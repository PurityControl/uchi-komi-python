#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Even Fibs

used loop running in inner function to generate the fibs. Then used list
comprehension to reduce the list and sum it.

- could improve efficiency by only adding to list if even (question: will
  it be that much more efficient?)
- would like to see a solutions using pythons iterators and generator
